# This file is ignored when creating the images! It is just an example
# Keys are the name of the variable to replace,
# values are the values to replace the variable with.
# The variables are replaced in the order they are defined in this file.
# When preparing a file for use with a template, a variable is defined
# by surrounding the variable name with three sets of curly braces.
# For example, the variable "variable_1" is defined as "{{{variable_1}}}".
# Yes, I know that is a lot of curly braces, but I wanted to make sure
# that the variable name would not be likely to be confused with a normal
# string in the file.

# The following special values are available:
# $DATE: The current date in the format TODO
# $TIME: The current time in the format TODO
# $DATETIME: The current date and time in the format TODO
# $HOSTNAME: The hostname of the machine the script is running on
# TOOD: Add more special values

variable_1 = "Hello, world!"
variable_2 = "This is a test"
date = "$DATE"
time = "$TIME"
